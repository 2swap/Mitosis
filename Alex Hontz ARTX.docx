A biology/art contest submission: Mitosis multiplayer online game

This was the document submitted with the assignment

Description: Move your cell around the map with the mouse. Be sure to avoid viruses!
Once one of your cells touches a virus, it will be killed, but your other cells will grow resistant to that color of virus.
Your cells show a short strand of DNA, and your task is to collect nucleotides around the map to write the complementary strand of DNA.
Once complete, your cell will turn green and chromosomes will align at the middle in preparation of when your cell splits! Press the space bar to split the green cell into two daughter cells. Their sister chromatids are momentarily visible.
The goal of the game is to grow your cells by eating green pellets, prokaryotes, and even other players to be the last player standing.

The game can be played here: *removed for github*. Be sure to invite friends, itâ€™s not much fun alone!
Please let me know how long you would like me to host the game there. I will take it down not long after the final lab, unless it needs to stay for grading.
Contact me at *removed for github*.
